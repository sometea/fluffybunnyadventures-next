We did not spend much time in Pescara, as we advice you not to do either, but got out of town for a little walk close to the village of Popoli. We discovered a beautiful castle ruin and enjoyed the sunny landscape. We also stumbled upon a local cat gathering.</span></p><p><img src=\"/images/posts/IMG_20201015_131644_z7q5zs.jpg\"></p><p><img src=\"/images/posts/IMG_20201015_133124_xtxbfn.jpg\"></p><p><img src=\"/images/posts/IMG_20201015_144127_erre0i.jpg\"></p>",
