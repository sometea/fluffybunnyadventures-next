We have been advised that this is the best time to visit the Austrian capital. \"What is Sturm?\", you may ask. It is a sweet and delicious drink of unfiltered, fermenting grape juice on its way to becoming wine. It is best enjoyed on a little hike through the wineyards around Vienna, on a sunny day and with good company.</span></p><p><img src=\"/images/posts/IMG_20201011_000550_zrj1gy.jpg\"></p><p><img src=\"/images/posts/IMG_20201010_133407_np6cyk.jpg\"></p>",
