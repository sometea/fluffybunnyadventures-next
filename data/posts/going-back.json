We took a plane from Palermo to Munich.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">Before that, we still had a bit of time to explore the city. Palermo is full of pretty buildings, churches, fountains, theatres, and statues, as well as delicious street food. We walked around enjoying the good weather and pretty sights.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">Now we are back in Munich, where we started. But can this really be the end? Or is this just the beginning of yet another fluffy bunny adventure?
